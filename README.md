# Brand Name Generator

## Introduction

You have been taught about loops and array methods. You are going to use that knowledge to build a `password generator`.
This project has a starter file that contains the HTMl and JS for the task.

# Your Task

Generating a very strong password is needed to secure our accounts but it can be difficult to generate one. Using a pattern, name, date of birth and others can be easily guessed by hackers. There are so many apps and extensions that sloves the problem of generation a strong passworg. Google is a very good example.Google gives suggestions for strong password. Have you ever wondered how the password is generated? You are going to build your own password generator in this project.

## Part 1

A part of the code has been written for you in the script.js file. There is an array of numbers, an array of special characters and an array of alphabets. The password will be from these arrays. There is also a `password_list` array which is empty and a `password` variable with empty string. These two will be talked about later.

-
- Write a prompt function that asks the user which city they grew up in and save their response in a variable.
- Write another prompt function that asks the user the name of their pet and save their response in a variable
- Remember a prompt function can be used to ask a user a question
- Example:

        const name = prompt("What is your name ?");

## Part 2

After asking for the city the user grew up and their pet's name in part 1, you will now use the response to generate a brand name for the user. Follow the steps below to acheive this

- Write an `alert` function to tell the user the name you suggest for their brand
- Remember an `alert` function is used to deliver a message to a user
- Example:

        alert("My name is Simeon");

- Suppose the city one of the users grew up in is Lagos and the name of their pet is Bingo, let the message passed to the alert function be in the format

       alert("The name of your brand can be Lagos Bingo");
